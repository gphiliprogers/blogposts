# Anzeneering

Joshua Kerievsky, CEO of Industrial Logic, and author of the book Refactoring to Patterns, has been a proponent of a concept that he calls "Anzeneering" for several years. Other people in the Agile community have taken notice, and there has been broad recognition of the wisdom behind the concept.
Kerievsky sums up the concept like this: 

> Protecting people is the most important thing we can do, because it frees people to take risks and unlocks their potential.

Kerievsky goes on to say that

> Anzeneers protect people by establishing anzen in everything from relationships to workspaces, codebases to processes,  products to services. Anzeneers consider everyone in the software ecosystem, whether they use, make, market, buy, sell or fund software. Anzeneers approach failure as an opportunity to introduce more anzen into their culture, practices, and tools.

Kerievsky describes just how central Anzen is by providing the following examples:

+ Anzen is a common denominator of every Lean and Agile practice.
+ Lean Startups protect our time and money via minimum viable products/features, validated learning and innovation accounting.
+ Extreme Programming's technical practices protect us from complexity, stress and defects via simple design, automated testing, continuous builds, test-driven development, refactoring and pair-programming.
+ Kanban protects us from bottlenecks and decreased flow via visualized work, limited work-in-process and classes of service.
+ Lean UX protects us from poor user experiences via interaction design and usability evaluations.
+ Retrospectives protect us from repeating the same mistakes.
+ Sustainable pace protects us from burnout, poor health and isolation.
+ Continuous deployment protects us from stressful, error-prone releases while enabling safe, high-speed production improvements.
